## A 3D Space Simulation


</div>

### Description

*- UPDATED -* NOW INCLUDES UFO's!!!

I've seen lots of boring screen savers around that have a few stars whizzing by. But they weren't true 3D, just pixels moving outwards. So I've written a program which randomly creates galaxies and you have complete freedom of flight - you can control the speed, pitch, roll and turning of your spacecraft. Plus there is even the option of increasing / decreasing galaxy density for better / worse / faster / slower graphics.
